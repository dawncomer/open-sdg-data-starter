Since employment data are not collected by CFOI, fatal injury rates are calculated using CPS and LAUS data. Each state rate in the table above represents the number of fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers and was calculated as:   Fatality rate = (NS/EHS) x 200,000,000 where        NS = number of fatal work injuries in the state        EHS = total hours worked by all employees in the state during the calendar year        200,000,000 = base for 100,000 equivalent full-time workers (working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year)              State rates by industry were imputed by using national-level \"average hours\"\u009d and \"at work\"\u009d information from CPS to calculate the average annual number of hours for each employee, since these data are not available at the state level. EHS (total hours worked by all employees in the state during the calendar year) was calculated as:   EHS = HWN x ES where        ES = State employment (from LAUS)        HWN = average annual number of hours for each employee at the national level (from CPS)","national_indicator_available":"Frequency of work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatal injuries - State of
